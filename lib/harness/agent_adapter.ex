defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter do
  @moduledoc """
  The contract every headless coding-agent adapter implements.

  An adapter is deliberately thin: it builds an agent's headless command line,
  spawns it over an OTP port, classifies the port's messages as raw output /
  termination / failure, and can kill an in-flight run. It does **not** parse or
  normalize the agent's output — harness passes raw transcripts through
  untouched (the consumer is an AI that reads them natively) and derives run
  success from its own verification stack, never from the agent's exit code or
  self-reported result.

  ## Implementing an adapter

  An adapter `use`s `Harness.AgentAdapter` (which declares the `@behaviour`) and
  implements the three required callbacks; `classify_message/2` and `terminate/1`
  have defaults (universal port classification and kill) and need only be
  overridden for agent-specific logic:

      defmodule MyAgent.Adapter do
        use Harness.AgentAdapter
        alias Harness.AgentAdapter.Capabilities
        alias Harness.AgentAdapter.Invocation

        @impl true
        def capabilities, do: %Capabilities{session_resume: true}

        @impl true
        def rule_channel, do: :prompt_preamble

        @impl true
        def build_command(%Invocation{rules: rules} = invocation) do
          prompt = rules.prompt || invocation.prompt
          {:ok, {"my-agent", ["-p", prompt], Map.to_list(invocation.env)}}
        end
      end

  Harness spawns the adapter with `invoke/2` — there is no per-adapter
  invocation boilerplate. `invoke/2` attaches caller-supplied rules (via
  `c:rule_channel/0`) before calling `c:build_command/1`.

  ## Run lifecycle

  `invoke/2` attaches caller-supplied rules (via `c:rule_channel/0`), builds the
  command via the adapter's `c:build_command/1`, and spawns the agent, returning
  a `Harness.AgentAdapter.Run`. The process that calls
  `invoke/2` becomes the port's connected process, so every subsequent port
  message is delivered to *it* — that process feeds each message through the
  adapter's `c:classify_message/2`, which is how raw output is captured and
  termination detected. A run ends when `classify_message/2` returns
  `:terminated` (the agent process closed) or `:error` (the port itself failed).
  `Harness.AgentAdapter.Driver` is the generic implementation of that drive
  loop — it adds raw-output accumulation and the total-run / idle timeout
  guards on top of `invoke/2` + `c:classify_message/2`.

  ## Deliberate deferrals

    * **Session-token extraction (resolved).** Resuming needs no dedicated
      token-extraction callback. The Claude Code adapter resumes the most recent
      conversation in `cwd` via `--continue`; because each harness job owns one
      worktree, "the latest session in `cwd`" is unambiguous. The
      `Harness.AgentAdapter.Invocation` `session` field stays an opaque
      pass-through value each adapter interprets as it needs.
    * **Availability probe.** A `version/0` / "is the binary installed" callback
      is anticipated for the capability + availability registry and will be
      added then as an optional callback.
