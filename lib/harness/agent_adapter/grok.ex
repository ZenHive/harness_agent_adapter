defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.Grok do
  @moduledoc """
  The headless adapter for Grok Build — driven via `grok -p` over an OTP port.

  Like every `Harness.AgentAdapter` it is thin: all the real logic is
  `build_command/1` assembling the headless command line. Raw output is captured
  and passed through unparsed; termination is detected from the port closing,
  never from the exit code.

  ## Invocation

  Runs `grok -p <prompt>` — `-p`/`--single` is Grok's single-turn headless flag,
  which takes the prompt as its value and exits when the response is done. Paired
  with `--output-format streaming-json` so the full agent transcript streams out
  as raw NDJSON events, captured verbatim.

  ## Permission mode

  `Harness.AgentAdapter.Invocation`'s `permission_mode` maps to Grok's
  `--permission-mode`. `:autonomous` — harness's unattended baseline — maps to
  `bypassPermissions`: harness runs in a throwaway worktree with no human to
  answer prompts, so the agent must edit files and run commands without asking.
  An unrecognized mode is a `build_command/1` error rather than a silent
  fallback.

  ## Working directory

  Wired by `Harness.AgentAdapter.invoke/2` (the port's `:cd`), not here — Grok
  inherits its working directory from the spawned process's cwd. Grok's own
  `--cwd` flag is therefore redundant, and `--worktree` is deliberately *not*
  passed: harness already owns the isolated git worktree the agent runs in.

  ## Session resume

  Resuming uses `--continue`, which reloads the most recent session **for the
  working directory**. That is exact here because every harness job owns one
  worktree, so "the most recent session in `cwd`" is unambiguous. Grok also
  accepts `--resume <session-id>`, but harness cannot obtain a session id
  without parsing agent output — which the raw-passthrough design forbids — so
  `--continue` is the only viable resume channel. The `Invocation` `session`
  field therefore carries the `:resume` sentinel, not a literal token; any other
  non-`nil` value is an error.

  ## Grok-specific extras

  Grok's headless-only knobs — `--best-of-n`, `--check`, the `--worktree`
  flag — are deliberately absent from `build_command/1`. They are not part of
  the core `Harness.AgentAdapter` behaviour; they belong to the capability +
  availability registry, which surfaces per-agent extras without
  widening the four-callback contract.
