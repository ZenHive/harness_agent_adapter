defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.Pi do
  @moduledoc """
  The headless adapter for pi.dev — driven via `pi -p --mode json` over an OTP port.

  Like every `Harness.AgentAdapter` it is thin: all the real logic is
  `build_command/1` assembling the headless command line. Raw output is
  captured and passed through unparsed; termination is detected from the port
  closing, never from the exit code.

  ## Invocation

  Runs `pi -p --mode json <prompt>`: `-p` / `--print` is pi's headless
  print-and-exit mode, `--mode json` switches the output to a one-event-per-line
  JSON event stream, captured verbatim. The working directory is wired by
  `Harness.AgentAdapter.invoke/2` (the port's `:cd`), not here.

  ## Permission mode

  pi.dev has no built-in permission-bypass flag — its design exposes the
  built-in tools by default and leaves "permission gates" to extensions, so the
  unattended baseline is the *default* binary behaviour and nothing extra is
  added to argv. `:autonomous` is the only mode accepted; any other value is a
  `build_command/1` error rather than a silent fallback.

  ## Rules injection

  pi auto-discovers `AGENTS.md` from cwd (walking up parent directories and
  reading `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` for global preferences), the same mechanism
  Codex uses. `rule_channel/0` therefore returns `:codex_ephemeral_file`: the
  caller-supplied rule content is written into the run worktree by
  `Harness.AgentAdapter.attach_rules/2` and cleaned up before delivery.

  ## Session resume

  Resuming uses `--continue`, pi's flag for "reload the most recent session".
  That is exact here because every harness job owns one worktree, so "the most
  recent session in `cwd`" is unambiguous — the same reasoning as the Claude
  adapter's `--continue`. Harness cannot obtain a pi session id without parsing
  agent output — which the raw-passthrough design forbids — so `--continue` is
  the only viable resume channel. The `Invocation` `session` field therefore
  carries the `:resume` sentinel, not a literal token; any other non-`nil`
  value is an error.

  ## Pi-specific extras

  pi.dev's headless-only knobs (`--provider`, `--thinking`, `--tools`,
  `--no-builtin-tools`, `--skill`, `--extension`, `--no-context-files`,
  `--fork`, `--no-session`) are deliberately absent from `build_command/1`.
  They are not part of the core `Harness.AgentAdapter` behaviour; they belong
  to the capability + availability registry, which surfaces
  per-agent extras without widening the four-callback contract.
