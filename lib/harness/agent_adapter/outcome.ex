  @moduledoc """
  The result of driving one agent run to completion.

  Returned inside `{:ok, outcome}` by `Harness.AgentAdapter.Driver.run/3`. The
  `kind` field — never `exit_status` — is the authoritative termination signal:
  harness derives *termination* from the process closing or a timeout firing,
  and *success* from the cross-family reviewer's `.harness/review.json` verdict,
  never from the agent's exit code.

  alias Harness.AgentAdapter.Run

  @typedoc """
  How a run ended: `:exited` (the process closed on its own),
  `{:timed_out, :idle}` (killed after the idle window elapsed with no output),
  `{:timed_out, :total}` (killed at the total-run budget),
  `{:reflex_halted, reason}` (killed by a deterministic mid-run guard), or
  `{:error, reason}` (the port itself failed mid-run).

      a timeout. **Advisory only** — recorded for diagnostics, never a success
      signal and never branched on.
