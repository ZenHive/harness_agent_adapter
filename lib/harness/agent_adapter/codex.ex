defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.Codex do
  @moduledoc """
  The headless adapter for Codex — driven via `codex exec` over an OTP port.

  harness's second concrete `Harness.AgentAdapter`, and the first real exercise
  of the behaviour as a *contract*. Codex's invocation is structurally unlike
  Claude's — `exec` is a subcommand, raw output is `--json` rather than
  `--output-format stream-json`, and resuming swaps in a whole different
  subcommand (`exec resume`) instead of adding a flag — so building it against
  the unchanged behaviour is what proves the contract is not Claude-shaped.

  Like every adapter it is thin: the real logic is `build_command/1` assembling
  the headless command line. Raw output is captured and passed through
  unparsed; termination is detected from the port closing, never from the exit
  code.

  ## Invocation

  Runs `codex exec --cd <worktree> --json` so the full agent transcript streams
  out as raw JSONL events, captured verbatim. The working directory is pinned
  on two channels: the port's `:cd` (the spawned process's actual cwd) **and**
  Codex's own `-C, --cd <DIR>` flag (the agent's "working root"). The flag is
  the load-bearing one — without it, Codex resolves its workspace from git
  plumbing and can follow a linked worktree's `.git` file (`gitdir:
  <repo>/.git/worktrees/<id>`) back to the main checkout's common git-dir,
  silently editing the parent repo instead of the run worktree — the same
  failure shape `agy`/Antigravity has. `--cd` is exec-level —
  it must precede the `resume` subcommand on a session-resume run (`exec
  resume --cd …` is a parse error in Codex's clap-based CLI).

  ## Permission mode

  `Harness.AgentAdapter.Invocation`'s `permission_mode` is checked against the
  one mode Codex's headless mode supports here: `:autonomous`, harness's
  unattended baseline. It maps to `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
  — Codex's flag for "skip every confirmation prompt and run without a sandbox",
  documented for exactly harness's situation: an externally sandboxed, throwaway
  worktree with no human to answer prompts. An unrecognized mode is a
  `build_command/1` error rather than a silent fallback.

  ## Session resume

  Resuming swaps the `exec` subcommand for `exec resume --last`, which reloads
  the most recent recorded session **in the working directory** (Codex filters
  recorded sessions by `cwd` unless `--all` is given). That is exact here
  because every harness job owns one worktree, so "the most recent session in
  `cwd`" is unambiguous — the same reasoning as the Claude adapter's
  `--continue`. Harness cannot obtain a Codex session id without parsing agent
  output, which the raw-passthrough design forbids, so `--last` is the only
  viable resume channel. The `Invocation` `session` field therefore carries the
  `:resume` sentinel, not a literal token; any other non-`nil` value is an
  error.
