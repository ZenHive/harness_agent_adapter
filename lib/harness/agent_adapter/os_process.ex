defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.OSProcess do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared lifecycle helpers for the OS process behind an adapter's OTP port.

  An adapter spawns its agent's headless CLI as an OS process connected to an
  OTP port (`Harness.AgentAdapter.invoke/2`). This module is the small,
  idempotent toolkit for the rest of that lifecycle — reading the OS pid,
  closing the port, draining stranded messages, and killing a run outright — so
  every adapter shares one correct implementation instead of re-deriving the
  `Port`/`kill` plumbing.

  `kill/1` SIGKILLs the immediate OS pid; tool subprocesses the agent itself
  spawned can be orphaned by that. Reaping those, and the working directories
  they leave behind, is the host application's job — this module reaps only the
  process it can see.

  Kills an in-flight run: SIGKILLs the OS process, closes its port, and drains
  any leftover port messages.

  Signals **before** closing the port: closing a `:spawn_executable` port reaps
  the OS process, after which the recorded `os_pid` may be recycled to an
  unrelated process — a `kill` landing then would hit the wrong target. With the
  port still open the pid is guaranteed to still name this run's process.

  Idempotent — safe to call on a run that has already ended. This is the default
  implementation an adapter's `c:Harness.AgentAdapter.terminate/1` delegates to.
