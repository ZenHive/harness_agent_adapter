defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.Testing.ConformanceCase do
  @moduledoc """
  The reusable conformance suite every `Harness.AgentAdapter` must pass.

  `use` it with the adapter under test — the whole suite is injected into the
  calling module:

      defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.ClaudeConformanceTest do
        use Harness.AgentAdapter.Testing.ConformanceCase, adapter: Harness.AgentAdapter.Claude
      end

  ## What it proves

  An adapter contributes four callbacks to the otherwise-generic run machinery
  (`Harness.AgentAdapter.invoke/2`, `Harness.AgentAdapter.Driver`). This suite
  pins the contract those callbacks must satisfy, across the six concerns the
  machinery depends on:

    * **Invocation** — `c:Harness.AgentAdapter.build_command/1` returns a
      spawnable `{executable, argv, env}` for the autonomous baseline and for
      every permission mode the adapter declares, and rejects an undeclared mode
      rather than falling back silently.
    * **Rule injection** — `c:Harness.AgentAdapter.rule_channel/0` declares how
      caller-supplied rules reach the agent; `build_command/1` output (argv and/or
      worktree files) reflects that channel. Adapters with `rule_channel/0` other
      than `:none` must call `Harness.AgentAdapter.attach_rules/2` so direct unit
      tests and `invoke/2` share the same delivery path.
    * **Raw-output capture** — `c:Harness.AgentAdapter.classify_message/2` maps a
      port data chunk to `{:output, bytes, run}` with the bytes **verbatim**:
      harness passes agent output through unparsed.
    * **Termination detection** — an `:exit_status` message maps to
      `{:terminated, run, status}`, carrying the exit code without judging it.
    * **Timeout** — when a driver-shaped receive loop abandons a run at its
      deadline, the adapter's `c:Harness.AgentAdapter.terminate/1` reaps the OS
      process. (The driver's own deadline *enforcement* is generic and tested in
      `Harness.AgentAdapter.DriverTest`; this is its adapter-scoped half.)
    * **Adapter-level cancellation** — `terminate/1` kills an in-flight run,
      releases its port, and is idempotent.

  External cancellation *orchestration* — a caller telling the running system to
  cancel a job — belongs to whatever supervised run lifecycle the host
  application wraps around the driver, and is out of scope here.

  ## Agent-free by design

  The contract tests never spawn the real coding agent. `classify_message/2` is
  exercised with synthesized port messages; `terminate/1` and the timeout path
  with a throwaway `/bin/sleep` standing in for the agent's OS process — an
  adapter's `classify_message/2` / `terminate/1` are agent-agnostic (they match
  port messages and delegate to `Harness.AgentAdapter.OSProcess`), so a stand-in
  port is a faithful exercise. One `:integration`-tagged test drives the real
  agent end to end through `Harness.AgentAdapter.Driver.run/3`; it `flunk`s with
  install instructions when the agent binary is absent.

  ## The gate

  This is the gate Codex and every later adapter (Cursor, Grok, ACP) are held
  to. A leak it catches is fixed in `Harness.AgentAdapter` — the behaviour —
  never patched around in the adapter.
