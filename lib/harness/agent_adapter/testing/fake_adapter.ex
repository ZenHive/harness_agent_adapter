defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.Testing.FakeAdapter do
  @moduledoc """
  A process-spawning fake `Harness.AgentAdapter` — the default implementer and
  reviewer double for tests that need a real OS process without a real coding
  agent, and live proof the behaviour is implementable in a handful of lines.

  Every `build_command/1` branch spawns a shell builtin, so raw-output capture,
  termination, both timeout paths, commit-worthy diffs, and the reviewer verdict
  artifact are all exercised deterministically and offline.

  ## Selecting a branch

  Pick the branch through the invocation's `adapter_opts`; the default is
  `:echo`.

      %Harness.AgentAdapter.Invocation{
        prompt: "fixture",
        cwd: worktree,
        adapter_opts: [command: {:review, "approve"}]
      }

  A `:recovery_command` entry is used instead of `:command` when the
  invocation's `log_tag` ends in `"-recovery"`, so one invocation can carry both
  an implementer branch and the recovery branch that follows it.

  The branch table itself is documented inline above `command_for/2` — it is
  long, churns with the fixtures that need it, and is read by whoever is adding
  a branch rather than by an API consumer.

  ## Model capability

  This adapter declares `model_families: []`: it spawns shell builtins and
  ignores `Harness.AgentAdapter.Invocation.model` entirely, so it is honestly
  model-INCAPABLE and a caller's model-required guard leaves the nil-model
  fixtures alone. When a test needs a *pinned* model to survive that guard, use
  the capable twin `Harness.AgentAdapter.Testing.FakeModelAdapter`.

  #                    that produced a real diff to commit.
  # :snapshot_worktree
  #                  — records cwd's file listing at agent run time
  #                    (provisioning-order fixture): a check grepping that

  # :write_then_hang — writes a file into cwd, then idles emitting nothing — a
  #                    timed-out agent that still left work to commit + grade.
  # :break_git       — overwrites the worktree's .git pointer, so the harness
  #                    commit step fails (the commit-failure fixture).
  # :detach_head     — writes a file into cwd then detaches HEAD at the run
  #                    branch tip (HEAD-moved fixture): proves commit/2 losslessly
  #                    re-attaches HEAD to the branch and lands the deliverable

  # {:write_then_wait_for_file, path}
  #                  — writes a file, then waits until path exists (batch cap fixture).
  # {:write_status_by_task, red_ids}
  #                  — writes a status file that fails checks for listed task ids.
  # :sleep           — stays alive emitting nothing (idle-timeout fixture).
  # :exit_code       — exits 3 with no output (advisory exit-status fixture).
  # :burst           — emits across pauses each shorter than a test idle window
  #                    (idle-reset fixture); the whole run outlasts that window.
  # :flood           — emits forever (total-timeout fixture; idle keeps resetting).
  # :missing         — an executable not on PATH (invoke-failure fixture).
  # :repair_noop     — churns a committable file but never satisfies a marker
  #                    check, so verification stays red — the red-implementer
  #                    fixture the reviewer-path tests build on.
  # :operator_steer  — first run writes attempt.txt; resumed run records the
  #                    operator steer prompt into operator_steer_marker.
  # :write_and_pollute_checkout
  #                  — writes into cwd and the main checkout, so pollution-skip
  #                    tests still have worktree changes to commit.
  # :move_cwd_aside    — writes a file, then moves cwd out of the way before
  #                    commit (missing-worktree fixture).
  # {:write_sibling_and_move_cwd, path}
  #                  — writes into a sibling worktree, then makes cwd disappear
  #                    (cross-worktree write regression fixture).
  #
  # Reviewer doubles (the agent-gate workflow's THE-gate fixtures) — each
  # writes the .harness/review.json verdict artifact harness reads mechanically:
  # {:review, verdict}        — writes ONLY the artifact (zero reviewer diff —
  #                             the first-attempt-pass fixture).
  # {:review_with_fix, verdict}
  #                           — writes a fix file then the artifact (nonzero
  #                             reviewer diff — the reviewer-fixed-it fixture).
  # {:review_capture_prompt, verdict}
  #                           — records the reviewer prompt into
  #                             reviewer_prompt.txt, then writes the artifact.
  # {:review_capture_model, verdict}
  #                           — records the reviewer invocation's model into
  #                             reviewer_model.txt, then writes the artifact.
  # {:review_capture_rmap_path, verdict}
  #                           — records `command -v rmap` from the reviewer
  #                             process, then writes the artifact.
  # :review_malformed         — writes invalid JSON to the artifact path (the
  #                             review-stuck fixture).
  # {:review_by_task, reject_ids}
  #                           — rejects the listed item ids, approves the rest
  #                             (per-task verdict fixture for batch tests; the
  #                             reviewer invocation's task_id is "<id>-review").
  # {:review_if_file, path}   — approves when the implementer left `path` in the
  #                             worktree; otherwise reports stuck in prose and
  #                             writes NO artifact (the batch fail-over fixture:
  #                             empty implementer diff → review_stuck).
  # {:review_verdict_by_file, path}
  #                           — approves when `path` exists, rejects otherwise —
  #                             always writes the artifact (per-implementer
  #                             verdict fixture for A/B comparison tests).
  #
  # Recovery doubles (bounded `.harness/recovery.json` seam fixtures) — selected
  # with `recovery_command:` when the invocation task id ends in "-recovery":
  # :recovery_clean       — moves `$HARNESS_RECOVERY_REPO/leaked.txt` into the
  #                         worktree artifact directory and
  #                         writes a repaired artifact.
  # :recovery_dead        — writes a dead artifact.
  #
  # Audit doubles (post-merge audit agent fixtures):
  # {:audit, short_sha}       — writes `.audit/<short_sha>.md` + the uncommitted
  #                             `.harness/audit.json` summary, then commits the
  #                             report as `audit(<short_sha>): ...` (the
  #                             audited-and-pushed fixture). Audit harness reads
  #                             the JSON best-effort and ff-pushes the commit.
  # {:audit_capture_prompt, short_sha}
  #                  — records the audit prompt into the committed
  #                    `.audit/<short_sha>.md`, so a test can read the prompt
  #                    back off origin after the ff-push (the audit-prompt
  #                    content fixture). The prompt rides as a positional
  #                    parameter ($2), never interpolated into the script.
  # {:audit_capture_rmap_path, short_sha}
  #                  — records `command -v rmap` into the committed
  #                    `.audit/<short_sha>.md`.
  # {:audit_cold_check_by_warm_marker, short_sha}
  #                  — writes `.harness/audit.json` with a cold_check fact that
  #                    is green when `_build` was warmed into the audit worktree
  #                    and red when the audit worktree is truly cold.
  # {:audit_cold_check_green, short_sha}
  #                  — writes a passing cold_check fact without committing.
