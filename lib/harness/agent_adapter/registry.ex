defmodule Harness.AgentAdapter.Registry do
  @moduledoc """
  Single source of truth mapping an adapter NAME (as an orchestrator passes it
  over a JSON boundary) to its `{adapter module, render agent}` pair.

  The render agent is what `rmap delegate` renders the prompt for; the adapter
  module is what actually executes. As of rmap's widened `delegate --to` enum
  (claude/codex/cursor/grok/antigravity/pi/droid), every harness adapter renders
  natively — name and render agent coincide. `droid` is renderable by rmap but
  has no harness adapter, so it never appears here and resolves to
  `{:unknown_adapter, "droid"}`.

  A leaf module — it depends on nothing but the adapter modules themselves, so
  every caller that has to turn a name into an adapter (a dispatcher, a
  merge-train fail-over list, an orchestrator reading a roadmap task's
  `assignee`) resolves against one table without a dependency cycle.
